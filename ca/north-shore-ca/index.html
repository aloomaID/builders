                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>North Shore is a census-designated place in southeastern Riverside County, so named because of its location along the northeast shore of the Salton Sea. It was once a popular vacation destination spot before ever-increasing salinity and pollution of the Salton Sea shut the tourist trade down. The population was 3,585 at the 2020 census, up from 3,477 at the 2010 census.</p>
