                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>'The settlement began at was is now known as Saegertown ca. 1795, when the brothers, Arthur and Patrick McGill, came to Woodcock Township. After Major Roger Alden built a sawmill in Saegertown, approximately 1800, the settlement was known for several years as Aldens Mill. In 1824, Daniel Saeger bought Alden's mill and adjacent lands and at the age of 44, he laid out the town under its present name. Saeger, a native of Pennsylvania of German descent, left Egypt, Pa. in 1823 to find a suitable place to settle. After he arrived in Saegertown, he attracted to the area a large number of German Yeomanry from Lehigh and other eastern Pa. counties. Being active in the community, Saeger was an early member of the Lutheran Church, the owner of a sawmill and general store, and a justice of the peace. He was a member of the Pa. State Legislature.'</p>
