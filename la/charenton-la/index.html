            <h3>Charenton, LA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Charenton (historically French: Lieu-des-Chetimachas) is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,903 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Morgan City Micropolitan Statistical Area. According to legend, the community received its name from one of the earliest settlers of the region, Alexandre Frere. Frere, a native of Paris, reportedly exclaimed on his deathbed that 'anyone choosing to move to that part of Louisiana belonged in Charenton!' Charenton was the name of a notorious insane asylum outside of Paris.</p>
