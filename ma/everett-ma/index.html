During these meetings, ask about their experience, project timelines, and the types of homes they specialize in. A reliable builder should communicate openly and be willing to address your questions and concerns.<br>It's crucial to verify the builder's credentials. Ensure they are licensed, insured, and bonded in Everett Massachusetts . This not only protects you but also reflects the builder’s commitment to adhering to industry regulations and standards.<br>Finally, request a portfolio of their previous work and ask for client references. Speaking with past clients will give you a clearer understanding of what to expect.
