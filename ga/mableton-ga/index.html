            <p>Mableton (/ˈmeɪbəltən/) is a city in Cobb County, Georgia, United States. Voters of the unincorporated area of Mableton approved a referendum to incorporate on November 8, 2022, and six council members were elected on March 21, 2023, with Michael Owens elected as Mayor in a runoff on April 21, 2023. According to the 2020 census, Mableton has a population of 78,000. Upon Brookhaven's cityhood in December 2012, Mableton was previously the largest unincorporated CDP in Metro Atlanta. With boundaries described in Appendix A of House Bill 839, Mableton is set to become the largest city in Cobb County in terms of population, and will include historical Mableton, along with the Six Flags area, areas of unincorporated Smyrna, and other residents of unincorporated South Cobb. While 53% of voters approved the referendum, many residents are already exploring deannexation.</p>
