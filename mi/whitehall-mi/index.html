            <h3>Whitehall, MI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>It is located on White Lake (actually the mouth of the White River). Whitehall's recorded history began circa 1859 when Charles Mears, a noted lumber baron to the area, platted the village along with Giles B. Slocum, naming it Mears. The population continued to grow due to its strategic location for floating and distributing lumber.</p>
